        <p> The Anti-Mage is a build focused on one goal: eliminating spellcasters. Uses spells from the divination and abjuration schools in order detect, dispel, and nullify magic abilities long enough to get in close and finish remove the source.

        <p>Born to a noble family, the anti-mage grew up with an extensive education in a culture where magic use a common practice. Even the least educated citizens were proficient in the use of some cantrip spells, but the anti-mage excelled at it; especially within the school of abjuration.</p>
        <p> When he was old enough, he joined the military, as was mandatory for all boys once they reached manhood. It was there that he studied tactical magic, utilizing his magic prowess to further his combative skills. While his martial abilities were not exceptional, his strategic thinking and his ability to weave magic into his fighting gave him an edge against his peers.</p>
        <p>Eventually, political intrigue among the magocratic rulers began to unfold. Alliance were formed and betrayed, political assassinations became a common occurrance, and those that were not naturally gifted with higher magical abilities were met with disdain and discrimination. Tensions rose steadily until one day, all hell broke loose.</p>
        <p>The high mages decided that any who did not achieve a certain level of magical proficiency were a drain on the society and were to be removed by force. Many families were expelled from their homes; those that resisted were slaughtered. Many young soldiers, who still several years of training ahead, sided with the high mages under the promise of amnesty and education in the higher forms of magic. Still others resisted the immoral actions of the high mages, until one day they attempted to seize the high mages tower. The resistance was met with magic power the likes of which none of them could have imagined the high mages possessed.  Some were killed outright with evocation spells. They were the lucky ones. Masses of charmed soldiers turned on their brothers in arms, cutting them down from the flanks. Others recieved terrible, horrifying visions that drove them mad. The worst fate was reserved for the officers of the resistance, as they were targeted by the high mage necromancers, and they slowly rotted alive, only to be brought back to unlife, fighting for their enemies.</p>
        <p>The anti-mage was one of the few that escaped the onslaught. After seeing the power the high mages possessed, he realized there was no way to beat them head on. The only way was to strip them of their abilities and to take each of them out one by one. He formed an elite group of assassins and taught them all his particular style of fighting and how to nullify and redirect their enemies' magic against them. In order to give themselves an advantage over the more experienced mages, they discarded their spellbooks, and copied them into intricate tattoos on their skin. Without cumbersome books, they were able to call on their spells quicker than even the mages. This gave them the edge they needed to take back their country.</p>

        <p> The Anti-Mage is predominantly a Wizard class that will take the War Magic archetype. Naturally, for a wizard, we will take Intelligence as our main stat, but instead of taking Constitution as our secondary stat, we will focus more into Dexterity. For example, a standard array set up might look like this: </p>
        <ul id="statRoll">
          <li>STR: 10</li>
          <li>DEX: 14</li>
          <li>CON: 13</li>
          <li>INT: 15</li>
          <li>WIS: 12</li>
          <li>CHA:  8</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As we level, we'll be taking lots of control spells, movement spells, and anything that weakens magic. Spells like <code>Minor Illusion</code> and <code>Mold Earth</code> are great cantrips to start off with and can be used in various situations. <code>Detect Magic</code> and <code>Mage Armor</code> will also be useful early on. Once you obtain 3rd level spells, you'll definitely grab <code>Dispel Magic</code> and <code>Counterspell</code> to bring your build online. Before that, just play as a control mage and don't get into melee unless absolutely necessary.
        <p>Now that we have 3rd level spells, it's time to get better at melee. For this, we'll take a two level dip into rogue. While the sneak attack bonus for a rogue is nice, our main reason for taking this is for <code>Expertise</code> and <code>Cunning Action</code>. Being able to triple our movement speed or being able to weave in and out of combat without provoking opportunity attacks is invaluable in this build.</p>
        <p><i>If you don't care about the 18th level wizard ability <code>Spell Mastery</code>, you can also dip into a level 3 rogue and take the Swashbuckler archetype, giving even more melee control options.</i></p>

        <p>The Anti-Mage serves a very important function in closing distance and taking out spellcasters during combat. The Anti-Mage utilizes it's high speed and mobility to get in and out of combat, while using defensive magic to nullify the enemy spellcasters offense. Most damage will come from melee, but because spellcasters typically have lower health points, high damage will not be a focus, in favor of damage mitigation. Outside of combat, the Anti-Mage is excellent at scouting, able to detect and disable magical traps and items. Any spell slots not being used for defense can also be used for divination spells, making the Anti-Mage a great recon build as well.</p>
        <p>While the Anti-Mage brings a lot of utility and control options, it is not meant for combat with multiple opponents or dedicated melee opponents. It does well isolating and dueling spellcasters, but would not fair well against a melee specialist considering the low AC and HP. If not rushing a spellcaster, you're best options are to utilize spells for control and assisting other players using the help action.

        <p>The Anti-Mage brings a lot of utility to an adventuring party and allows for excellent battlefield control. It is a difficult build to master, but can be very rewarding for those that prefer a more tactical playstyle over an overpowering style of play.</p>
